Here's a short note to announce a re-release of version 2013.02, now as version 2013.02.11 but it's specifically for [OS X Mavericks].

It doesn't contain any new or unreleased features, but instead fixes an issue involving the libgcrypt dependency lookup as the application starts. If you're not yet using Mavericks you should continue to use the older version [2013.02][].

For everyone else: we're still working towards the next version, with support for links _(hard or soft, take your pick)_, it's just that if the system doesn't support links (Android/Windows) there needs to be a way to fail gracefully and without corruption or data loss.

Until next time ...

[2013.02]: /downloads/encrypt/2013.02/encrypt-2013.02-x86_64.dmg
[OS X Mavericks]: /downloads/encrypt/2013.02/encrypt-2013.02.11-x86_64.dmg
