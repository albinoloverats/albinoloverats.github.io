It may be long overdue, but finally, after over two years (although a day early if you check the release notes), we are back with another release of our flagship product [encrypt](/projects/encrypt). The big ticket item this time around is configurable KDF iterations.

We have also put together a Solaris package and the start of a Gentoo eBuild file. One snag that we have discovered is that the OS X application—once copied from the disk image to Applications—the extended attribute  gets set and this seems to break the applications checksum. As such, a warning message that says the application may be damaged is displayed. This can be worked-around by opening the terminal and executing the following: . This will recursively clear all extended attributes, and solves the problem. It's not ideal, but it'll have to do for now; we're working on a more user-friendly solution (perhaps distributing via the App Store is the way to go).

That's it for now, hopefully everything works smoothly and we haven't missed any compatibility issues/major bugs. So all that's left to say is Happy New Year and bring on 2020!
