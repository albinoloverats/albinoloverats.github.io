Not only has encrypt gone "pro", but so have we! We've improved the way that remove does the removing so the process is a lot quicker.

The GUI and Windows editions are now looking like proper products (which they are). And the bug which caused remove to bail if it couldn't find a file has been fixed - it will tell you it couldn't find the file then move on.

Later :)
