Okay, so here we are, back again _(finally)_ with a completely new [stegfs]! And when we say new, we mean totally rewritten! It's much better at not overwriting your existing files (although it can and will still happen) and it's a lot more customisable.

**Warning!** stegfs 2015.08 is not backwards compatible!

However, onto the good stuff:

 * More bytes for data, less for metadata
 * Choose your crypto at mkfs time (now using [libcrypt])
 * File systems are no longer architecture dependant (score one for
   network byte order!)
 * There's no longer any need to prefix directories with +
 * And hopefully the code generally all round better than before (having
   been rewritten with a few more years experience, et cetera)

Lo, there too are a number of sad points:

 * stegfs is not (yet) multi-threaded—if you have a large
   read/write, it will block—this is something we're looking at
   working on soon
 * As was mentioned above: it's not backwards compatible, but hopefully
   it will be as we move forward

I think that's pretty much everything for now; sorry it's been so long, but (as far as file systems go I feel) too many releases are likely to negatively affect stability, hence the delay.

Stay safe,
Ashley
