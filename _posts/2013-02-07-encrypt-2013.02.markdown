It's only been a couple of months, but we're back with our latest offering: encrypt-2013.02

The single biggest new feature of this release is the support for encrypting whole directory trees. So where before you would select just a single file to encrypt, now you can select a directory and encrypt it and all of its children. _(This does not include selecting multiple files; you need to have a single root folder.)_

The other significant milestone achieved with this release is the inclusion of a native Mac OS X 64-bit application :) For all you Apple fans, you no longer have to struggle with Homebrew and X11 to secure your files and folders across various platforms.

The final change was a bug fix around the use of a key file when using the GTK GUI.

That's it this time, see you soon.
