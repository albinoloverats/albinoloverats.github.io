Well, it's been awhile since we've made any public advancements here, but whilst we can't say exactly what we're working on, we can say it'll blow your mind!

In the run-up to Xmas and the New Year we hope to release both updated versions of encrypt and remove, and by then we should have started coding our new "mystery" project.

Anyway, be patient and all will unfold in the coming weeks and months.

Thanks, albinoloverats.net
