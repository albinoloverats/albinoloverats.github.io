It's been nearly a year, and during that time there has been numerous updates to the FUSE library, one of which started causing problems with stegfs. We've been able to quickly push out a fix, and hopefully this will give the motivation to resume working on stegfs instead of neglecting it. As there are no new features or changes to the file system layout there shouldn't be any issues with compatibility with 2015.08 but if there are just let us know.

So here it is, the quick fix that is: [stegfs 2015.08.1](/projects/stegfs)

Enjoy
