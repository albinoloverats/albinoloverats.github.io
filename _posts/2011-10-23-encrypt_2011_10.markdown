We back _(so soon?)_ with another release of encrypt. It fixes a couple of simple bugs that found their way in to the last release, and makes way for future improvements. The major fix is the calculated checksum for verifying the data after decryption.

Also, for those using encrypt on systems where there are no automatic updates (just about everywhere at the moment) a handy status bar will indicate if a new release is available :)

As always, there's packages for various Linux's: Arch/Debian/Red Hat, as well as Windows and the latest: Android!

Later...
