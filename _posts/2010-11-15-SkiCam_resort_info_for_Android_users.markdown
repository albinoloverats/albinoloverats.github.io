Having started out as a way of learning the ways of the Android development process (as well as a way of keeping myself up-to-date with the current conditions in Verbier) SkiCam has evolved to a point where it made sense to share it with the masses*.

SkiCam will be available in the Android Market in the coming weeks, and will hopefully find its way in to (at least) a few pockets before the ski season really gets under way.

Cheers,
Ash
