We have now release a finally version for 0.6: it's uber sexy - full dynamic library support, full GUI - in both Linux and Windows! Oh yeah!

The GUI doesn't yet fully implement everything it once did, however that does give us something to work towards :p we hope to get a proper "about" box working, which will also show details of the selected algorithm.

There are a few other things that will need touching up the code which varies between the *nix and MS packages but we'll fix those as we come to them.

Enjoy... :)
