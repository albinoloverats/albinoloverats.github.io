It's been nearly two years, but we have finally brought out a new release of our flagship [encrypt](/projects/encrypt)ion application.

There have been a host of changes and bug fixes, including improved key derivation and MAC authentication. There are two new binary packages available: FreeBSD and Windows (64 bit); Win32 has gone the way of the dodo and is no longer available. We have also fixed the Android version to work properly with its latest permission handling.

Downloads are available in all the usual places; so until next time, stay secure.
