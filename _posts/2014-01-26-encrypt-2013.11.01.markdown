Following on from the previous post, which explained that the latest version of libgcrypt no longer had a couple of functions that were use to get a list of supported algorithms, we have an updated version of encrypt that overcomes this. Currently this issue only affects GUN/Linux systems (Arch/Debian/Fedora), but it could manifest itself in OS X (if/when Homebrew updates its version of libgcrypt) so we'll see about rebuilding that edition too.

**Neither the Android nor Windows editions are effected.**

The latest binary packages are available from the downloads directory as normal.

Until next time,
The encrypt Dev Team
