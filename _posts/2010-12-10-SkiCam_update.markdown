Although a little belated, SkiCam version 0.14 is available for purchase from the Android Market. It has support for FranÃ§aise, Deutsch, Italiano and EspaÃ±ol to please our non-English speaking users :)

To help reduce bandwidth requirements, we've slimmed the download for the App itself, and also implemented a check for changes before downloading the list of resorts.

We're still working on additional artwork for the resort view, as well as trying to translate SkiCam into as many languages as is useful, whilst trying to add more resorts. If you're able to help get in touch :)

Later ...
