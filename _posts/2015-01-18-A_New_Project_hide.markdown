It's time for a new project: [hide][]. And as the name suggests, it hides data. It is in fact a steganographic image tool.

We've been slowly working on it for a couple of months now, and were really hoping to have (particularly) the UI a little more polished, but unfortunately the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has decided to go _above and beyond_ by proposing to [outlaw encryption][BBC].

If he intends to have you _brought in for questioning_ just because he cannot read the data your transmitting across the internet, how about we provide everyone with a simple way to share cat pictures while still getting your message across ;-)

It's still very much in development, but is usable and works excellently along side [encrypt][]. Currently only the lossless image formats [PNG][], [TIFF], and [WebP][] are supported through shared object libraries. Check out the [project page][hide] as well as the [source code][gco] (and the lovely test images of myself running).
