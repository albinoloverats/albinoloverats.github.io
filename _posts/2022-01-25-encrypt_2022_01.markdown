Well, it's been another 2 years but we're back with another release of [encrypt](/projects/encrypt)! On the face of it, it would appear that very little has changed but there has been significant changes under the covers, a lot of which should help with error reporting and debugging (if you're unlucky enough to need it).

There is now a PKG installer for Apple OS X, although as encrypt is not yet signed (and distributed via the AppStore), it will generate a warning about being untrusted; this can be overridden in the security settings. There is also still not a complete Gentoo eBuild solution, but we'll get there one day.

That's all for now,
