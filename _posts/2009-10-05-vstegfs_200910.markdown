We've put together another release of vstegfs; there's been a few changes to the code and one or two minor fixes, but nothing major or ground-breaking.

There are packages available for systems supporting either DEB or RPM - however they are only for 64 bit systems - there are no 32 bit builds: you will have to build from source yourself.  This makes a change from the last release which was 32 bit only, and is due to time and availability for building and testing on such architectures.

Until next time,
The vstegfs Dev Team
