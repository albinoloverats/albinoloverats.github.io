Yes, we're still here! And we're back with a vengeance, or at least a revolution.

A new version of encrypt is available for Arch, Debian and Fedora based Linux distributions, as well as Microsoft Windows XP (and newer).

**There is now also an Android version!**

It's fully compatible with the desktop version - as you'd expect - so that transferring file/documents between your PC and smartphone can now be done securely, on your own terms, even via services such as Dropbox.

Let us know what you think; if there are any problems, we'll do our best to sort things out :-)

Peace, safety and security...
