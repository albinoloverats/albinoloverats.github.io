We now have our own SSL Certificate - which works throughout the albinoloverats.net domain. All links to non https:// addresses are automatically redirected for your convenience :)

Due to the certificate being not being for sub domains, we've removed those for [url=/projects/encrypt]encrypt[/url] and [url=/projects/remove]remove[/url] and they can now be found at the above addresses for quick reference - which forward to the long addresses (with all the PHP variables).

Anyway, for the most part nothing much else has changed - after finals, a "normal" development routine will resume.
