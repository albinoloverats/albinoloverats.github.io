Biennially seems to be how we release recently, if you can call the last 8 or 9 years recent! Again, there aren't too many _on the surface_ changes, but there are a handful of bug fixes and improvements in reliability---especially on Android.

Library dependencies have been updated, and this is especially relevant on OS X as there the dependency management was incomplete and dependant on [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (building encrypt still is but at least is should now function properly without it).

Stay secure,
