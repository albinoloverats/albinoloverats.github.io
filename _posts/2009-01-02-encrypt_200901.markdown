We've a new release of encrypt ready and waiting!  Version 200901 is available for download as a source tar/bz2 and MS Windows installer - as before - however, we have also put together both packages for Debian and Fedora :)

[color=black][edit][/color]The DEB package has also been successfully installed on Ubuntu 8.10 and the RPM now also on openSUSE 11.1 :)[color=black][/edit][/color]

Modules no longer need to be downloaded separately, all available algorithms are now included as part of the standard code base; as are all of the files needed to build all of the binary packages.

Anyway, take the code, binaries, and return to us your bug reports and we'll see you with the next release :)
