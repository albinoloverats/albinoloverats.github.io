With changes to almost every malloc call to ensure memory access is clean and efficient. This applies to all three releases, with both the GTK interfaces being straightened out; not only aesthetically but also structurally with regards to the underlying code.

We've even set a goal for our next release: to add support for further encryption algorithm plugins, thus allowing you to choose how your data is encrypted. We hope this will increase encrypt's popularity as it will then support most major methods of encryption as simple plugins.
