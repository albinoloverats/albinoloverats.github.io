We've been working on encrypt for a few weeks now, and have finally been able to port it to MS Windows. The plugins are intended to be DLL files; using Dev-C++ you should be able to build them (as a DLL project). And the main binary compiles using [code]gcc encrypt.c -o encrypt.exe[/code] nice and simple. As we haven't extensively tested the Win port we can't really say what will happen, but it seems ok.

We're still working on a GUI, and as soon as that is finished we expect to be ready for a proper release, instead of SVN.

Later...
