[s]You can now email either of the teams here at albinoloverats.net or the Webmaster safe in the knowledge that (1) only we're reading what you write, and (2) our replies do actually come from us.

All published keys can be found here.

Individual team members will make their own public keys available as they see fit.[/s]

[update]Public keys are stored in the user profiles, and you can either extract the key and use if with your mail client, or use the web form provided.[/update]
