It's not been quite as long between updates this time around, but Google kind of forced our hand by threatening to close our developer account due to lack of use. So here we are with a few minor bug fixes and maybe a dependency update or two.

Hopefully people are still find it useful to have local file encryption applications that are cross-platform; we still find it useful if we need sensitive documents on difference devices and it needs to be secure when at rest, though for transferring SSH obviously helps a lot.

Anyway, until next time,
