It's been a long time coming, but we've finally simplified our site and
moved everything to Github. Student life with its ample free time is a
distant memory these days and keeping up with the changes in PHP to
ensure our site runs well is less of a priority. And using Jekyll on top
of Github Pages is more than capable of hosting (mostly) static pages,
as well as providing a bug tracker.

Although we have migrated all of the previous posts there is still some
polishing of rough edges, particularly getting SSL to work as expected;
we will also need to see what solutions exist for email (maybe we'll
move over to AWS?)...

Anyway, that's all for now.
