albinoloverats is a software development company committed to developing
decent, reliable software. Releasing our source code under the terms of
the GNU General Public License allows us to achieve this through your
help: you are encouraged to assist and improve our products (fixing
bugs, suggesting—or even writing—improvements). We're not trying for the
most flashy (cluttered) products, or the most colourful (goofy) looking
interface, but to show that simplicity is often the best method—to do
one thing and do it well—the original Unix way. Computers were designed
to make life easier; why should you have to search through menu after
menu to find what you're looking for when all you need to do is type (or
possibly click) and go?! We aim to provide simple, clean, effective
applications to ease your work.  Our focus is on security software for
individual users; your work is your work, keep it that way, don't let
anyone else steal you idea.

“security is not something you can buy; it is something you must get” —
Bruce Schneier.
